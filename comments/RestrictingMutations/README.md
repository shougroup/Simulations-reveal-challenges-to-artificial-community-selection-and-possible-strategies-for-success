## [Restricting mutation events to the end of a community maturation cycle may not help community selection](https://github.com/shougroup/artificial-community-selection/raw/master/comments/RestrictingMutations/RestrictingMutations.png)

Restricting mutation events to the end of a community maturation cycle might help community selection since non-producers will not have time to take over, postulated Daniel Weissman (Emory Physics). We performed simulations with or without restricting mutations to the last 20% of each maturation cycle while keeping the total mutation events per cycle comparable. We observed similar selection outcomes. This is presumably due to (at least) the following reasons: First, even if we do not restrict mutation events, 50% of cell division events -- and thus 50% of mutations -- occur during the last division cycle. Second, we have already set the maturation cycle to be short (6~7 generations) so that newly-arising non-producers will not have a chance to take over. Third, restricting the timing of mutations does not resolve the problem of interference from non-heritable variations in community function.
